    <em>I was inspired by watching cartoons in my childhood and thought of creating my own cartoon which lead to the rise of Anime.<br />
      Anime is an art form and it is alot more than just a cartoon.I have collaborated with lots of manga writters and had a huge<br />
      part in creation of animes like <u><a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/attack-on-titan">Attack on titan</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba">Demon slayor</a>,
        <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/naruto-shippuden">Naruto</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/one-piece">One piece</a></u> etc etc. Infact I was the one who suggested<br />
      titles for those animes and when the writters were in pinch they used to contact me and ask for ideas and how to plot the situation.
